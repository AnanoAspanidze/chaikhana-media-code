Within the framework of this educational initiative, intensive training was conducted for 50 adolescents from Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the villages of Shida Kartli, where the families affected by the 2008 Russia-Georgia war live. The aim of the project was, on the one hand, to display what young people know about the media and digital literacy in the conflict regions of the South Caucasus, and on the other hand, to fill this knowledge gap; <span id="dots">...</span><span onclick="readMore()" class="read-more-btn">Read More</span><span id="hidden-txt">

Closing the borders has doubly hurt people whose movement was restricted by long-running political or ethnic conflicts. In March 2020, the Enguri bridge, which divides Samegrelo and Abkhazia, was closed indefinitely. This record, based on the experience of a Gali student, describes the difficulties of returning to families across the bridge.

                    <article>“This five-day media literacy program was my first and most serious project in terms of non-formal education. During the time I spent with you and the attractive mentors, I gained a lot of interesting information and good experience ... I will apply the knowledge gained during the project in practice. This project has paved the way for me in many directions. For example, in the projects I am currently participating in, the knowledge and experience gained from your project are helping me a lot. I took a computer skills course, and more or less, we touched on media literacy and social media-related topics in general. I cannot describe how good it feels when you already have an idea about this and that topic, and then use it in various tasks or communication. If someone asks me what the best memory of this summer was, I will say it without thinking - mediacode2021! "</article>

Besides, during the project, I touched on practical topics like mobile photography and videography that are beneficial every day. I look at the information spread on social networks more critically today than before. I learned a lot about cyber security. I can only say positive things about this project."</article>

                    <article>"Media literacy is extremely crucial in today's environment where social networking is so popular that it is difficult to identify true and false content in a massive flow of information. That's why every action that helps young people comprehend media literacy, both theoretically and practically, will increase the chance of gaining a better media environment in the future. This initiative, in my opinion, served this purpose, and it would be much more intriguing if the Training of Trainers was provided so that young people could share their experiences with others in a comfortable environment."</article>
