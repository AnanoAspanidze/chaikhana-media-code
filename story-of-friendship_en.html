        <p class="audio-desc">
          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I was newly discharged from the hospital and spent most of my days talking to friends and classmates to make up for the lost time. In conversations, one name was frequently echoed. I had heard the same name from others, always in a positive context. In her absence, I happened to already know this girl. Then I got her phone number and called her.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:One evening, I remember, I was in the kitchen, cleaning dishes when the mobile called. It was an unknown number, which made me a little disturbed. I picked up the phone, and someone said, "Hello, can I talk to Teona?" "Yes, I said, who are you? Where did you get my number from?" "I'd like to meet you" - though this was a girl's voice. It seemed weird to me. Even so, there was something imperative in her tone.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Even today, I'm not sure what prompted me to call her because it's not something I'm used to. I called and she answered. "Are you Teona?" "Yes, who are you?" She answered the question with the question. And her Bohemian persona has already appeared. <br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: I thought someone was calling because there had been another quarrel. I was captious during those times and could not tolerate injustice anywhere. We talked, and it turned out that we had a lot in common. It came to light that we also had mutual friends. Every evening, Salome phoned. At the time, I did not believe in tight friendships. I was disappointed. So, I was getting along with the boys better. Salome turned out to be like me. I recall that 15 minutes before she phoned, I had been grumbling to my mum about friendship and school: "I think I will never have a person next to me who will be more than a friend." Then my mother told me, "Do not hurry; everything has its time. You will meet someone who will be everything to you. Just take the time and wait". At this point, the phone rang. It was Salome.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>:"You don't know who I am, but I'd want to get to know you." There was a long break after I said it. I expressed these words very happily. Then, I took advantage of the silence and started talking about her. She realized I’d already known a lot. She had no idea who I was or why I had learned so much about her. I gave a brief description of myself and purposely concealed the story of my blindness. Finally, I cracked a joke about something. In the end, it seemed as if we'd been dating for years.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Everything in my life has been drastically changed after this phone call.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: We've been together since. Teona, I, and our mutual friend met on September 1st, as far as I recall. Teona is a precious person to me, more than a friend, and no one will replace her.<br /><br />
          <<<<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Hello, I am Teona Akhalaia, 20 years old, from Abkhazia, Gali.<br /><br />


          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Hello, I am Salome Ketsbaia, 20 years old, from Abkhazia, Gali.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Now that I look back, I was under a lot of stress at the time. I always longed and dreamed of having such a person...  I no longer believed I'd have a good friend. I began blaming myself and looking for a fault within myself. Now that I think about it, I was fortunate. I’ve found Salome.<br /><br />
          <<<<br /><br />

          {Walk in Kikvidze Park}<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Finally, Teona and I came to Kikvidze Park together.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: I always wanted to walk here with you.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: With me?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yes, I call you in the evenings. I imagine you are here with me. There is so much greenery here. Everything calms down. When the wind blows, everything is so beautiful.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: The wind is blowing, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing...Leaves are swept along its path…<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yeah, that's exactly it.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Rows of trees, armies of trees bend and sway… Where are you, where are you, where are you?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Where are you, Salome? Where are you?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Oh, I liked the traffic light we caught here. Generally, I love an inclusive environment where I do not feel like an alien.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:  Do you feel so alien?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Sometimes, yes! For example, when you get on the bus with a walking stick, they look at you in surprise.<br /><br />
          
          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yeah, I hear.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Somehow, it is not a pleasant thing.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Sometimes, When I describe something, what does it look like in your imagination?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Well, describe where we are now.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: There are roads, like <span class="red">дорожки</span>.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Roads?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:Yeah, <span class="red">дорожки</span>. They tie in the center. Certain things fall somewhere in the middle. <span class="red">Точно не знаю</span> . (I'm not sure exactly what it is) You mentioned an alien. Over there, there's something that looks like <span class="red">тарелка</span> (an alien plate).<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: (laughs) Yeah, it seems like he is from my circle.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Everything looks so clean. You can even set up a picnic.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Wow!<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yes, even now some people have come for a picnic… <span class="red">Парочки держатся за руки</span> (Hand in hand couple).<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I can even hear the sound of music from afar.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yes, there is a children's playground (says in Russian). <br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>:  In the open air?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Oh, yes...Also, there is something else in front of us. But I think it does not work. In America and other countries, similar spaces exist. Children come to study there; do you know?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Ah, yes, I was told that people go there and sit at the computers. It is an outdoor space, similar to a library.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yes, and everything can be seen around. I always want something like it.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: There are <span class="red">беседки</span> (gazebos) behind it and tables too. <br /><br />
          ....<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Have I ever said that to you? It was World Sight Day, and we held a small rally. About ten blind people stood with walking sticks outside the Metro Avlabari. At this point, someone comes up to us and says, "Wow, are you athletes? You know what I am like. I could not control myself and died laughing. Maybe we look like skiers, but still, I do not know.<br /><br />
          
          .....<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Salo, how did you like my description?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I enjoyed that, especially given that you originally depicted very different settings. I especially liked the “weeping” episode. I like it too much, but ...<br /><br />
          
          <<<<br /><br />

          {Back to Kikvidze Park}<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: I can’t describe it because I do not know the exact name.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Well, and in Russian?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Even in Russian, I have no idea what it's called.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: What’s this? Что это?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:  <span class="red">такие понурые деревья</span>. (Tree with fallen branches)<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Well…<span class="red">плакучая ива</span> ? (Weeping willow?) Oh!<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:<span class="red">да, да, ива!</span> (Oh, yes! Willow!) Do you know how beautiful it is? Let's take a selfie or a snapshot.  <br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: How tall are you, girl? (Laughs)<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Have you felt that height now?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: No, of course! <br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Oops, now you see how lovely it is? That the wind has blown and shaken it.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: The tree with the branches growing down surprised me the first time I saw it. Then I learned it was a <span class="red">плакучая ива</span> (weeping willow). Love it, you know?!<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: How does it make you feel?<br><br>

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I don’t know ... I can’t say that I could compare myself, but at some point, I love it very much.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Do you know what it makes me think of? This is when...<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: And if it even stands on the water shore...<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: It reminds me of human life.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Do you know what kind of person? A very tormented human being.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: At the very least, he has to survive; he does not fall. And if he does, he strives to ascend to the top.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: He's still alive, sure...<br /><br />

          <<<<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Look at what's relevant right now in the description... Some people are born blind, and others lose their sight over time. For example, a person who has been blind since birth may inquire about color. He may not even ask if it is not important to him. If this tree had flowers, I would ask you what color each blossom was. I am like that. Well, you described it nicely, especially the moment when people looked at me as an "alien," because we often feel that way.<br /><br />

          <<<<br /><br />

          {Back to Kikvidze Park}<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Oops, look how beautiful it is!<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I've already seen it. Do you know how I saw it? This weeping willow stood on a tiny hill at an uplifted spot.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Stop, I am taking a selfie ...<br /><br />

          <<<<br /><br />
          
          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: You recall a day when you and your blind friends were treated as aliens while going through Kikvidze Park. I've heard other stereotypes about blind people. The blind, for example, have a unique sense of hearing.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: (laughs) Yes, I've heard this a million times, and it's a complete stereotype. A sighted person perceives 70% of the information with the eyes. But the brain of a blind person does not strain in this direction. He has entirely switched to hearing since he does not acquire information through sight, but he has the same hearing as a person who is not visually handicapped. It's just that his brain doesn't devote as much time to seeing. That's why blind often referred to as having "extraordinary hearing." It isn't the case at all.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: A blind person, on the other hand, is unable to move independently. What can you say about it?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: In Georgia, it is difficult for a blind person to walk independently, but with a walking stick, he does. When the city and the country are set up in the right way, this is simple. Cars should not be parked on curbs, among several other impediments.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: How do blind people use technology?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: That often surprises others, too. We use special programs that voice everything. We also read books and use social networking sites. Overall, this program is fully beneficial to us in many ways.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: How do blind people get an education?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Across Georgia, there is only one boarding school in Tbilisi where we get an education. I also graduated from this school... I learned Braille there. It seemed hard at first, but it did not turn out to be so... Because this is more of the computer age, in high school, Braille is replaced by technology, and learning continues through special reader programs. We do what the sighted person does on the phone and the computer.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: The independent life of the blind is unimaginable for me. Is that so?<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Yes, to tell you the truth, before I lost my sight, I also had hardly imagined the life of the blind. It's not like that; the blind person can cook, clean, and move around; all the states have to do is make it possible for them to do so. In this case, the blind can live independently. I also have heard stereotypes about the blind, but I'm curious whether you've found out any about yourself as someone who befriends the blind.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yes, I've heard that several times. Though I was not told directly, I sensed it in a relationship. It has been said that I befriend you out of pity. I am baffled at how people can be friends because of something... It's a terrible vision.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Do you see it? It is again because society has little information about the blind. In reality, it is a bit vague and unimaginable to live independently, receive an education, etc. The blind person isn’t the only one who needs help. No way! The blind are ordinary people.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>:  It's impossible to be someone's friend out of compassion. Personally, I never do anything like that. You're still the same person you were when we first met. You are an ordinary person to me.<br /><br />
          
          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: There is nothing special about it. I also understand those folks since they have no information. Awareness is low. Many people with disabilities conquer the peaks that sighted people do not reach.<br /><br />

          <<<<br /><br />

          {Kikvidze Park ... Music can be heard from afar}<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Do you see? The concert was held because I’ve come here.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yea! You are lucky! Let's watch, and I'll describe you... я же твои глаза все-таки (So, I’ll be your eyes)<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: You are my eyes today.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: It’s already started. Oops, it has even been fenced around. <span class="red">Пошли снова к иве</span>  (Let’s go to Willow tree again)<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: It's called willow, I guess, if I'm not mistaken.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Yea… Weeping willow.<br /><br />

          <<<<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: Teona, we share one soul in two bodies.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Teona</span>: Friendship is believed to be one soul in the bodies of two individuals, and a friend is someone who wordlessly understands your grief and joy. That's exactly when he shares your happiness, not just sadness.<br /><br />

          <span class="name-friend">Salome</span>: I wish with all my heart and soul for you, people, to have someone like Teona by your side, as she is for me and I am for her.
