        <p class="diary-txt diary=txt-1">
          I woke up at 8 o'clock in the morning and got ready. A day full of emotions is waiting for me. I'm a little nervous, which is natural. Who wouldn't be anxious about lengthy, dangerous, and
          illegal travel?! I know I'll be home in the evening, hugging my mother and having a good time, and it’s worth worrying . I still have some time before I return from Zugdidi to my home, Gali.
          <br /><br />
          We left the apartment, laden with bags. We're waiting for a taxi that I called for at 12 o'clock. The driver couldn't locate me. So, I'm getting a bit nervous. I’m explaining where to come.
          He could hardly find me. One man was sitting next to the driver. Finally, we placed our bags and sat down.<br /><br />
          The passenger tells me: <br><br>
          - Do you go through the forest and the river?<br /><br />
          - No, I'll surrender to the Russians directly and pay the fine in the bank.<br /><br />
          (At the time of writing, the Enguri Bridge was temporarily closed due to the pandemic)<br /><br />
          - I am frightened... If they catch me, they will beat me. If I had a document, I would also surrender, but I do not have one.<br /><br />
          - Where are you going, sir?<br /><br />
          - In Ochamchire, my relative passed away... There is no other way! How not to go to the funeral? Again, he says he is afraid of being caught and beaten.<br /><br />
          We came to Khurcha, where our police stand. The driver and the police know each other, it seems. The police ask cynically:<br /><br />
          - Are these guests?<br /><br />
          -Yes, they are.<br /><br />
          *** <br /><br />
          Yes, it was cynical because the police knew where we were going. The quarantine was lifted, but we still had to get away from the police. I paid 50 GEL to the driver to tell them that I was
          a guest; I'm not sure how much he received from the second passenger. He paid after I left the car. It's most likely the same.<br /><br />
          I arrived. It is already a familiar place. I recalled how often we used to come here. Years ago, to-ing and fro-ing were so simple. I also remembered where my father loved to sit... He was
          also a taxi driver. He used to take passengers from our village…<br /><br />
          Well, it's time to go.<br /><br />
          I got out and crossed the border. Then I took everything out. I had to pass that way twice. I entered the nut-grove first, then the yard, and finally knocked on the door. I entered through
          the first door, then through the second. Nobody was here. It was obvious that they lived there. I went to the Russian hall of residence. I saw my mother from a distance. She was waving her
          hand at me. There was another Russian woman who crossed the border secretly like me. My mother immediately told the Russians that I was already here and they could have come. A Russian
          approached me and greeted me:<br /><br />
          -добрый день (good afternoon)<br /><br />
          -добрый. (Hello!)<br /><br />
          -ваши документы пожалуйста (your documents, please)<br /><br />
          -вот (Here you are).<br /><br />
          He looked down at it and let my mother reach to me and take the things off. I handed the bags to our relative, who was accompanying my mother. I saw that mum also came to me. I rushed
          towards her. At that time, I heard:<br /><br />
          - девочка туда нельзя (hey, girl, can't go there!)<br /><br />
          I looked at my mother and handed over the bags. We were both so excited. I should have kissed and hugged her, but we were not allowed to do that. After my mum went, a Russian woman and I
          stayed and tried to get to know each other. She had heart surgery in Kutaisi a year and a half ago. She misses her children and grandchildren. She asked me:<br /><br />
          - Should I call and tell them that I am going or leave it as a surprise?<br /><br />
          -Of course, you leave it as a surprise. I would be delighted, - I said.<br /><br />
          She wonders when the moment will come for our unity; we are so close but so far apart; who has heard of such a thing? She knows our pain, and she appears to be a good woman. We had to wait
          for several hours. Finally, a large truck called the "Urali" came and put us inside. We drove roughly. It was an awful thing. As it turned out, we reached Gali. They took us upstairs and
          informed us that we would not receive our documents unless we paid 3,000 rubles in the bank. I ran to the bank. There, I was told that I needed to pay 3020 rubles. I held 20 rubles less.
          Then I had to wait for half an hour before I was allowed to go. I brought the fine receipt, and they gave me the document. I am free. I liked this feeling very much.<br /><br />
          I hurried to see my sister, who works at a kindergarten. I was also hoping to see my nieces. I kissed and hugged my sister. Then I woke the nieces up. I caressed them a lot and walked away.
          Along the way, I was once again convinced of how beautiful our side was; every aspect appeared ideal and simple to me. I took a walk to the train station. Then I hitch-hiked to my village,
          making only one stop. I only went a kilometer and a half, and the neighbors were hailing me along the way.<br /><br />
          - Wow, Nana, hello!<br /><br />
          - What is new, Nana? How we miss you!<br /><br />
          I returned home. When the sound of the gate was heard, my dogs quickly barked and fawned, as if they were telling me: "Welcome back..." And the home is still so lovely. I took one step
          towards the threshold and stopped. Suddenly, I imagined how my father would meet me: his twinkling eyes in front of me, a smile, and work-damaged hands with which he hugged and caressed
          me.<br /><br />
          "It’s enough! He is always with me" - I wiped my tears, smiled, and entered the house.<br /><br />
          - "Mom, I’ve come!" I called. My mum comes out of the kitchen with bright eyes.<br /><br />
          - Welcome home, darling!<br /><br />
          - May God help us to meet each other forever, mum!<br /><br />
